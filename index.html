    <p>I am a second-year PhD student in computer science at the University of Michigan working in the <a href="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~dkoutra/group/index.html">GEMS Lab</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~dkoutra">Danai Koutra</a>. Specifically, my current research is primarily in matrix approximation techniques for large-scale machine learning problems.  I am interested in how these can affect the theoretical performance of classification, regression, and clustering algorithms, and in how they may be used in large-scale applications such as graph mining.   </p>

    <p>Other significant pursuits of mine include chess, where I am an active master-level player in both the United States Chess Federation and FIDE, and music.  I am interested in creating artificial intelligence technology for music analysis and performance, as well as augmenting acoustic instruments and compositions with electronic technology. </p>
